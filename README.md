# Notes for TensorFlow Lite Micro Library Arduino

This repository is for me to write notes on the micro_speech.ino example and other files which are required for it. The intention of this is to study the TensorFlow API so I can impement it within AI projects in the future. I am uploading this so that both me and my project partner can understand further how to implement the API onto our [Alarm Clock Project](https://github.com/a6eline/ML_arduino_alarm).

This is forked from the original [tflite-micro-arduino-examples](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro-arduino-examples) GitHub repository. Installation info is all there. 

## My Contribution

### Micro_speech Example
Within the examples folder, I have written as much comments as I can within micro_speech example to better understand each file and its usages. 

### Micro_speech Documentation 
I have also written a [word documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WiQw86Ue8yddEHVPHRZVkMrpHQOxgGgfX3WtC2Yl9dU/edit?tab=t.hnpsgq8m388t) for this so that I can gain better understanding of it.
